# Felipe_Lima_DataScientist

The objective here is to analyze a given dataset, make a exploratory data analysis and answer the proposed questions.]
I used the Google Colab to make all python code.

Please, access the [Felipe's Analysis](https://github.com/Felipe-dpl/Felipe_Lima_DataScientist/blob/master/FelipeLima_DataScientist.ipynb) to see all the work done.

## Case 1
The first dataset is the TFP.csv.

The series is composed by TFP (rtfpna variable) at constant national prices (2005 = 1) for three countries.

I forecasted 10 years of the series and answered the following question: 'Can you think about another feature that could be helpful in explaining TFP series? Explain'

## Case 2

The second dataset is the comexstat.csv and the auxiliary covariates.xlsx.

The objective was to answer the following questions and use data visualization means to explain them:

- Show the evolution of total monthly and total annual exports from Brazil (all states and to everywhere) of ‘soybeans’, ‘soybean oil’ and ‘soybean meal’;

- What are the 3 most important products exported by Brazil in the last 5 years?

- What are the main routes through which Brazil have been exporting ‘corn’ in the last few years? Are there differences in the relative importancem of routes depending on the product?

- Which countries have been the most important trade partners for Brazil in terms of ‘corn’ and ‘sugar’ in the last 3 years?

- For each of the products in the dataset, show the 5 most important states in terms of exports?
